HTML-Linked-to-Inline
=====================

This program will take all of the linked scripts and css files and build them into one big html file.]

When developing a web app, it is nice to have all of your javascript and html in seperate files in other directories.
It makes version control easier, and error messages actually have meaning. 

But when it comes to deploying, nothing is as easy as throwing a single .html file up onto your server.

This is where HTML-Linked-to-Inline comes in handy.  It looks for places where you've linked javascript or css and it 
inlines the whole file!
